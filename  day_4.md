Today i continued with the previous topic and learnt about some of the Python Libraries.

# Introduction to TensorFlow

## What is TensorFlow?
- TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.It is one of the two most popular deep learning libraries alongside PyTorch.

- It was developed by the Google Brain team for Google's internal use in research and production. The initial version was released under the Apache License 2.0 in 2015. Google released an updated version, TensorFlow 2.0 in September 2019.

- TensorFlow can be used in a wide variety of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, C++, and Java facilitating its use in a range of applications in many sectors.

# Introduction to Scikit-Learn

## What is Scikit-Learn
Scikit-learn is a popular open-source Python library for machine learning, built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib. It provides easy-to-use tools for building and evaluating machine learning models, including both supervised (e.g., regression, classification) and unsupervised (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction) algorithms. With features for data preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning, Scikit-learn is widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling. Its simple API, extensive documentation, and integration with other Python libraries make it a go-to tool for both beginners and experts in machine learning.

## Key Features:
- User-Friendly API: Consistent interface with methods like fit(), predict(), and score().
- Preprocessing Tools: Utilities for data normalization, encoding categorical variables, and handling missing values.
- Model Selection: Tools for hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
- Integration: Works well with other libraries like pandas and matplotlib.

## Use Cases:
- Classification: Identifying categories (e.g., spam detection).
- Regression: Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices).
- Clustering: Grouping similar data points (e.g., customer segmentation).
- Scikit-learn is essential for anyone looking to develop machine learning models efficiently and effectively.

#Introduction to PyTorch

- PyTorch is a machine learning library based on the Torch library used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing originally developed by Meta AI and now part of the Linux Foundation umbrella. It is one of the two most popular deep learning libraries alongside TensorFlow, offering free and open-source software released under the modified BSD license. Although the Python interface is more polished and the primary focus of development, PyTorch also has a C++ interface.

- A number of pieces of deep learning software are built on top of PyTorch, including Tesla Autopilot Uber's Pyro, Hugging Face's Transformers, PyTorch Lightning and Catalyst.

- PyTorch provides two high-level features

1. Tensor computing (like NumPy) with strong acceleration via graphics processing units (GPU).
2. Deep neural networks built on a tape-based automatic differentiation system.
