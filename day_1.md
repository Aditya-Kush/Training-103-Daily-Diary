# BASIC ABOUT PYTHON
On first day, I focused on understanding the Python programming language’s core concepts which are essential for the project. I learned the foundational elements, its uses and Installation of Python to get comfortable with the language with 2 simple prpgrams.

## Key Concepts Covered:
1. Variables: Introduction to data types such as integers, floats, strings, and lists.
2. Control Structures: if, elif, else statements for decision-making and loops (for, while) for repetitive tasks.
3. Functions: How to define reusable code blocks using the def keyword.
4. Modules and Libraries: How to import built-in and external modules, using import for libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

## What is Python?
- Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
- Python is an easy to learn powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing together with its interpreted nature make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
- It is used for Web development (server-side), Software development, Mathematics, System scripting.

## What can Python do?
- Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
- Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
- Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
- Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
- Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

## Why Python?
Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

## Simple program in Python to Print Hello World.

```python

print('Hello World')

```

## Simple program in Python for addition of two numbers.

```python

a = int(input('Enter 1st number'))
b = int(input('Enter 2nd number'))
c = a + b
print(c)

```

## Today's Learning Summary:
Today, I learned that Python is a versatile programming language used for web development, data analysis and more. It has a simple syntax and works across multiple platforms. I explored variables, control structures like loops and if-else statements, functions and how to use modules like pandas and numpy. I wrote two simple programs: one to print "Hello World" and another to add two numbers entered by the user which helped me understand the core functionalities of Python.
