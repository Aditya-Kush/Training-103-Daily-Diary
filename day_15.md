# EVALUATION METRICES
Today, I explored the importance of evaluation metrics in Machine Learning gaining a better understanding of how they help assess the performance of a model. These metrics are crucial for understanding how well a model generalizes to unseen data and for improving its accuracy through model tuning.

## Introduction to Evaluation Metrics
- Evaluation metrics are essential tools in machine learning that allow us to quantify the performance of models. They help us understand how well a model has learned to make predictions and how well it generalizes to new and unseen data. These metrics vary depending on the type of task (such as Classification, Regression or Clustering) and can be used to compare different models and select the best one.

- In Machine learning, we mainly deal with Supervised learning problems where the model is trained using labeled data. After training, we evaluate the model's performance using various metrics that measure how closely the model's predictions match the actual target values.

## Key Evaluation Metrics for Machine Learning

### 1. Accuracy:
Accuracy is one of the most commonly used metrics especially for Classification problems. It measures the proportion of correct predictions to the total number of predictions.

### 2. Precision:
Precision, also known as Positive Predictive Value measures the accuracy of the positive predictions. It tells us how many of the predicted positives are actually positive.

### 3. Recall (Sensitivity):
Recall, also known as Sensitivity or True Positive Rate measures the ability of the model to capture all positive instances. It tells us how many actual positives were correctly identified by the model.

### 4. F1-Score:
The F1-Score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall providing a balance between the two. It's particularly useful when the class distribution is imbalanced.

### 5.ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve):
The ROC-AUC score evaluates how well the model distinguishes between classes. AUC stands for "Area Under the Curve" and the ROC curve plots the True Positive Rate (Recall) against the False Positive Rate (1 - Specificity).
A higher AUC indicates a better performing model.

### 6. Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
MAE is a metric used for Regression tasks. It measures the average of the absolute errors between the predicted values and the actual values.

### 7. Mean Squared Error (MSE):
MSE is another metric for Regression tasks. It calculates the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. MSE punishes larger errors more severely.

### 8.R² (R-Squared):
R² is a measure of how well the model's predictions approximate the real data points. It indicates how much of the variance in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variables.

 ## Working of Evaluation Metrics

1. Model Training: The model is trained on the training data, learning the relationships between features and target variables.

2. Model Predictions: After training, the model makes predictions on new or test data that it has not seen before.

3. Calculating the Metrics: After making predictions, I evaluate the model’s performance by comparing its predictions against the true values (labels) using appropriate metrics.

4. Improving the Model: Based on the results from these metrics, I can refine the model, tune hyperparameters, or choose a different model to improve performance.

## Examples of Applying Evaluation Metrics

### 1. Classification Problem (e.g., Spam Detection):
- If the goal is to identify spam emails, The accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC would be useful metrics.
- For example, A high precision would mean fewer false positives (non-spam emails marked as spam) while a high recall would mean catching as many spam emails as possible.

### 2. Regression Problem (e.g., House Price Prediction):
For predicting house prices, metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² would be appropriate. MAE gives a simple interpretation of how far off the model’s predictions are, while R² tells us how well the model explains the variance in house prices.

## Today’s Learning Summary:
Today, I gained an understanding of the different evaluation metrics used in machine learning. I learned how to choose the appropriate metric for different types of problems whether it’s Classification or Regression. For Classification tasks, I explored metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and ROC-AUC. While For Regression tasks, I learned about MAE, MSE and R². These metrics are key to assessing model performance and improving its accuracy by guiding decision-making in model selection and optimization.
