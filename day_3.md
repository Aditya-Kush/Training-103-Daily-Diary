# PYTHON LIBRARIES
Today i learnt about some of the Python Libraries.
---
Pythonâ€™s standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of facilities as indicated by the long table of contents listed below. The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs.
The Python installers for the Windows platform usually include the entire standard library and often also include many additional components. For Unix-like operating systems Python is normally provided as a collection of packages, so it may be necessary to use the packaging tools provided with the operating system to obtain some or all of the optional components.

# Introduction to NumPy

## What is NumPy?
- NumPy stands for Numerical Python.
- NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
- It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
- NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.

## Why Use NumPy?
- In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.
- NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
- The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.
- Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.

# Introduction to Pandas

## What is Pandas?
- Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.
- It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
- The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

## Why Use Pandas?
- Relevant data is very important in data science.
- Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.
- Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.

## What Can Pandas Do?
- Pandas gives you answers about the data. 
- Like:
- Is there a correlation between two or more columns?
- What is average value?
- Max value?
- Min value?
- Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong values, like empty or NULL values. This is called cleaning the data.

# Introduction to Matplotlib

## What is Matplotlib?
- Matplotlib is a low level graph plotting library in python that serves as a visualization utility.
- Matplotlib was created by John D. Hunter.
- Matplotlib is open source and we can use it freely.
- Matplotlib is mostly written in python, a few segments are written in C, Objective-C and Javascript for Platform compatibility.

# Introduction to SciPy

## What is SciPy?
- SciPy is a scientific computation library that uses NumPy underneath.
- SciPy stands for Scientific Python.
- It provides more utility functions for optimization, stats and signal processing.
- Like NumPy, SciPy is open source so we can use it freely.
- SciPy was created by NumPy's creator Travis Olliphant.
- SciPy has optimized and added functions that are frequently used in NumPy and Data Science.
- SciPy is predominantly written in Python, but a few segments are written in C.
