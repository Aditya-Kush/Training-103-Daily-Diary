## Install Python 3 with the Official Installer
Python is one of the most powerful programming languages, mostly used in data science, machine learning, and big data analytics. So, installing Python is essential for all programmers.
Here are the following steps for the Installation of Python : 

### Step 1. 
First, download an installer package from the Python website. To do that, visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ on your Mac; it detects your operating system automatically and shows a big button for downloading the latest version of Python installer on your Mac. If it doesn't, click the macOS link and choose the latest Python release.

### Step 2. 
Once the download is complete, double-click the package to start installing Python. The installer will walk you through a wizard to complete the installation, and in most cases, the default settings work well, so install it like the other applications on macOS. You may also have to enter your Mac password to let it know that you agree with installing Python.

### Step 3. 
When the installation completes, it will open up the Python folder.

### Step 4. 
Let’s verify that the latest version of Python and IDLE installed correctly. To do that, double-click IDLE, which is the integrated development environment shipped with Python. 

### Step 5. 
Let’s write a simple Python code and run it in IDLE. Type the following statement, and hit the return key.


```python

x = 5
y = 10

temp = x
x = y
y = temp

print('The value of x after swapping: {}'.format(x))
print('The value of y after swapping: {}'.format(y))

```

## Today's Learning Summary:
 Today I learned how to install Python 3 on macOS. First, I downloaded the installer from the official Python website. After completing the installation via the wizard, I verified the installation by running Python's IDLE and writing a simple Python script to swap values between two variables confirming that Python was installed correctly.
