# INSTALLATION OF PYTHON
Python is one of the most powerful programming languages, mostly used in data science, machine learning, and big data analytics. So, installing Python is essential for all programmers.
## Install Python 3 with the Official Installer
1. First, download an installer package from the Python website. To do that, visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ on your Mac; it detects your operating system automatically and shows a big button for downloading the latest version of Python installer on your Mac. If it doesn't, click the macOS link and choose the latest Python release.

2. Once the download is complete, double-click the package to start installing Python. The installer will walk you through a wizard to complete the installation, and in most cases, the default settings work well, so install it like the other applications on macOS. You may also have to enter your Mac password to let it know that you agree with installing Python.

3. When the installation completes, it will open up the Python folder.

4. Let’s verify that the latest version of Python and IDLE installed correctly. To do that, double-click IDLE, which is the integrated development environment shipped with Python. 

5. Let’s write a simple Python code and run it in IDLE. Type the following statement, and hit the return key.

```python

a = int(input('Enter 1st number'))
b = int(input('Enter 2nd number'))
c = a + b
print(c)

```
